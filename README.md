# Coding Challenge: Fruit Inventory

This repository contains my solutions to a not-too-complex data handling problem, presented at [glitch.me](https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/) and with its source in the [TestSource](TestSource) directory here.

The problem is based off one of several interview problems used by {a member of a forum I frequent} to judge each job candidate's coding ability.
