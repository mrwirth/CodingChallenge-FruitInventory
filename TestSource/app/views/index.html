        <p>Write a program that loads a text file with fruit inventory data, processes it, and displays the results on screen.</p>
        <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
        <h3 id="general-requirements">General requirements</h3>
        <p>Try to write your solution in a professional manner, not like a one-off script. As this is an interview problem you can create
            a more complex solution than the problem requires in order to demonstrate your knowledge and skill. However, keep in
            mind that working and simple is far better than complex and broken.</p>
        <p>You may write solution in the language and environment of your choice.  Googling is allowed, but excessive copying <em>may</em>
            count against you.</p>
        <h3 id="specific-requirements">Specific requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fetch the data from one of the data sources listed below. You should start with the static data, and then if possible
                make sure your solution also works on the increasingly difficult dynamic data sources.
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on the static data: getting it to work with the dynamic data sources is extra credit, but failing to get
                        it working with the static data will count against you.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Deduplicate the fruits by keeping only the first occurrence of each fruit.</li>
            <li>Filter the fruits by removing all fruit with a unit price less than $30.</li>
            <li>Sort the fruits by quantity, from most to least.</li>
            <li>Present the results as a table with its columns in the following order: Product name, Price, Amount.  A table header is
                optional, and the table need not be in HTML.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="data-sources">Data sources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Static data: <a href="https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/static-data.txt" class="uri">https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/static-data.txt</a></li>
            <li>Data with variable fruits: <a href="https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/vary-fruits.txt" class="uri">https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/vary-fruits.txt</a></li>
            <li>Data with variable fruits and column widths: <a href="https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/vary-fruits-and-widths.txt" class="uri">https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/vary-fruits-and-widths.txt</a></li>
            <li>Data with variable fruits, column widths, and column ordering: <a href="https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/vary-everything.txt">https://resonant-shoulder.glitch.me/vary-everything.txt</a></li>

        <h2 id="notes-on-data-quality-and-variety">Notes on data quality and variety</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can assume the data was input manually, so there may be extra or missing spaces within a column. However, columns
                will align vertically.</li>
            <li>The only mass units involved will be grams and kilograms, in the form of the standard abbreviations <code>g</code> and
                <code>kg</code>.</li>
            <li>Price will always be in dollars ($).</li>
