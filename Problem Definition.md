# Coding Challenge: Fruit Inventory

This challenge focuses on fetching, parsing, transforming, filtering, and presenting data from a
web resource representing a fruit inventory.  The bulk of the challenge lies in parsing the text
file representing the inventory, which imitates a hand-crafted and manually maintained data table.
